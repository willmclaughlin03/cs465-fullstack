CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN



Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

In the frontend, Express, JS, and SPA were all used to render different forms of content in static and dynamic ways. Express was used for the static pages that contained descriptions, while JavaScript was used to dynamically render images and functions to connect MongoDB to the frontent, allowing us to edit trips or login. SPA was used to bolster user experience with a seamless transition when loading our frontend and using it.

The backend used NoSQL Mongo as it is extremely scalable, which is needed for a travel site with many users, as well as it is able to handle large amounts of data that is needed for a website flexibly.

Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is different from JS as it is used to only transmit data from front to backend, as it is a language that both can understand and use through requests. JS is a language used for rendering applications, so typically you would use JS to build your webpage, and then use JSON to format the data requests, allowing JS to communicate with the backend.

An instance of changing code would include when we refactored the trips page into a JSON file to improve its rendering and reusability throughout the project through images and dynamic rendering.


Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Methods, endpoints, and security are all important factors of testing in a fullstack application and each play different roles. Testing security is crucial for a proper application as you want user data to be safe. Implementing security through encryption and authentication then testing these requests in Postman methods is very important. Using Postman to test your API's functionality and security by using methods allows for a site that works and is efficent/


Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me realize all the different factors that come into play when making a fullstack application. Before, building something like this was somewhat of a question, as I did not know how the individual factors worked together. But now I have learned how to implement all factors of creation and testing of a full stact application.
